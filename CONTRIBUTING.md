## ToDo list

* <s>The `laws.pl` must be completed with all the conservation laws (rules).</s>
* <s>In the same script a meta_laws rule should be created which checks if any of the conservation laws is being broken.</s>
* Create [unit tests](https://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/doc_for?object=section(%27packages/plunit.html%27)) by using well known reactions.
* Finish the `list_of_possible_interactions.md`.
* Create tests by using reactions that break one or more of the conservation laws, and thus are not being observed in nature.
* Find a way to produce possible reactions that are valid (don't break any of the laws), but have not been observed yet (knowledge based physics?).
* Find a way to produce all possible reactions that are valid.
* Insert your idea here.
